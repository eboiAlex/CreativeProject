        Castlevania is the first game in the series. It depicts the exploits of a vampire hunter named
        Simon Belmont, who inherited a whip brimming with holy power from his father.

        Castlevania consists of six linear stages with a boss at the end of each stage. The stages
         represent areas of Dracula's decrepit castle, and the enemies are typically taken from horror 
         literature, lore and films. Castlevania is an action-adventure platformer that emphasizes 
         precision and timing. Players begin the game with four lives and five Hearts.

        Simon's primary weapon is his whip, the Vampire Killer. The Vampire Killer can be upgraded
         to boost attack strength and length. Upgrades and items are found by striking candelabras or by killing enemies.
